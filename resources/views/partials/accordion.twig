        <div class="accordion__content">
            <p>It most cases no. Our professional and skilled field team is trained to identity strategic areas to apply the treatment to reduce the likelihood that it can be effected or washed  away by rain. Examples of these strategic areas would be underneath leaves and other shaded areas. But if by some chance the effectiveness of our treatment is compromised by rain or some other factor just give us a call and weâ€™ll come back and reapply.</p>

        <h6 class="accordion__title">How does it work?</h6>
        <div class="accordion__content">
            <p>At Mosquito Killers, we offer a variety of mosquito control solutions that we tailor to your specific needs. Our most common treatment is our 21-Day Barrier Spray. This works by repetitively treating standing water, foliage and other potential mosquito breeding sites with larvae. This eliminates the existing larvae and significantly reduces the likely hood of mosquito hatching in the future. Once that is done, our field team, will treat highly susceptible areas around your yard to eliminate existing adult mosquitoes an to create a barrier against new additional mosquitoes from entering your yard. We will then return every 21 days reapply and maintain the barrier.</p>
