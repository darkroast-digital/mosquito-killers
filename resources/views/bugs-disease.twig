                        <li><strong>Get Mosquito Repellent Plants.</strong> There are certain plants that Mosquitoes hate! If you plant or place: feverfew, citronella, catnip and lavender around your yard youâ€™ll create a very mosquito-unfriendly environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eliminate Standing Water.</strong> This is where Mosquitoes lay eggs. Getting rid or reducing standing/stagnant water in and around your yard can help reduce your mosquito population.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make your yard Bat-Friendly.</strong> The average bat can eat up to 1,000 mosquitoes per night. Purchasing or building a bat house in your yard will invite Natures Own Mosquito Killers to come patrol your yard for free.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Mosquito Traps.</strong> Build your own or buy one. Placing one of these in a high mosquito area will reduce the number of mosquitoes that are roaming free to bite you and your family.</li>

It starts as a virus that usually resolves itself, but in the cases that it worsens, it can invade the central nervous system and cause encephalitis.
